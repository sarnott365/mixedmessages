# Wacky Weather Forecast - Codecademy Project: Mixed Messages

This script creates a random, probably non-sensical, weather forecast
based on the requirements of the Codecademy project.

1. The script must create a randomly generated message.
2. There should be at least three different pieces of data used to make the message.
3. Use Javascript, Git version control, display locally on computer

## Implementation

The Wacky Weather forecast is made up of the following parts:
1. A random city name from an array of cities.
2. A random overall weather condition from an array of conditions.
3. If the overall condition is "wet" or "overcast", from 1 to 3 types of precipitation will be included in the forecast.
4. Low temperature will be generated between -40 to 100F.
5. High temperature will be generated between -40 to 115F and must also be greater than or equal to the low. 

## Future Development

* get the cities, overall conditions and precipitation types from stored files
